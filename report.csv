My brain was so imbalanced from my drug use that at the time, I needed medication. However, the initial euphoric reaction I had to it faded, and my quack doctor increased my dosage more and more. By 2008 I was on 300 mg, the maximum dose. I stayed on it, out of fear. Why was I afraid? Because missing a dose even by a matter of hours made me experience severe withdrawal. In the beginning, I dropped 30 pounds in 3 months, but then gained it all back slowly and no matter how healthy I ate or how often I excersised, I couldn't lose weight. My hair also stopped growing. Finally with enough support from family and friends, I tapered down. It's taken almost 2 years to go from 300 to 75 mg. Each time I taper, I have debilitating withdrawal. Nausea, sweating, anxiety, mood swings, body aches, brain zaps (feels like fireworks going off in my head) and extreme trouble organizing thoughts. But my hair grew and I lost weight. My mood became stable and I was generally more upbeat. I stopped getting overly upset at small things and my energy skyrocketed. I have to wonder what must be in this medication that makes withdrawal reduce me to the fetal position, crying in a pool of sweat, and taking less of it makes my hair grow and restores my metabolism. Ican't wait to be done with this. It's taken me to hell and back. It traps you into a physical dependency that makes it impossible to skip a dose or stop, because withdrawal is so scary and the half life is so short that if I forget to take it and leave for work in the morning, I have to anticipate getting sick by the afternoon.

The hardest part was waiting for it to work, It took atleast 5/6 weeks. I wanted to quit many times, but stuck with it. Weird side effects along the way but help from Dr., Therapist and friends helped. The other problem was I expected when it did work to immediately make the depression just go away.  Found out  it don't work that way  I guess the depression came on slowly (thou I never realized) and it goes away slowly.  So I seemed to feel best in the evening and worst in the morning. Dr. said that's normal with depression. The other hurdle to get over is I'll be feeling like my old self for a day or two and  boom  out of the clear blue it creeps back.  Which at first really scared me and pissed me off.  How dare it, after all that hard work. But, with patience I slowly start feeling better again. Quite a roller coaster ride.

The original prescribing doctor left the state six months after putting me on it but said it would only take a yearfor me to stablize emotionally and be taken off of it. Since going on it I have been diagnosed with Disassociative Personality Disorder; I have also become an alcoholic. When I told my doctor how much I drank, he told me I really shouldn't do that any more. I am suicidal but benefit from the personality disorder since part of me remains the caretaker of human beings and animals and birds that I have been for my whole life. My brother shot his rifle at me because I had refused to let him molest me at less than 9 years of age, my father both sexually assualted and abused me at an early age and also told me that I should have been killed as a defective being; my mother told me from an early age that as the second born twin I would have been killed at birth hadI been born in Africa. (note: I'm not African). I thought Ecstapin RX would help me get through a difficult stage as a government whistle blower. Instead I am addicted to it and lorazapan and alcohol. If I didn't have the ability and opportunity to care for beings and creatures less fortunate, I would have left this world.  No, I don't think any medicene that requires taking it for 12 years and with no end in sight is good. Treating a symptom does not treat the person or the cause.  And anyone on these medsshould realize that most medical studies only look at the complications of usage for 6 months or less. The analytical side of me tells me that there is something very wrong in an advanced society that perpetuates drug usage rather than helping individualsto overcome emotional trauma.

After about a year it felt like the Abidal was sucking energy from me instead of giving it to me,I was tired physically and mentally, I started getting bran zaps, sometimes slurred speech, confusion or brain fog, and I could feel the anxiety slowly creeping back in the picture. So my doctor switched me over to Elevex however getting off of Abidal is no easy task!

To say the least, it's no cake walk and you probably will slip and take one just for a break in the withdrawal symptoms but be strong and stay at it and the symptoms will slowly subside. I finally stopped having withdrawal symptoms about 2 months after stopping Abidal. I implore anyone researching Abidal to try Elevex first; I've been on it for about a year and a half now and couldn't be happier. I hope this helps!
